<p>Now that summer’s here, it’s t-shirt weather, and I’m sure there will be many opportunities for you to to wear interesting designs and promote your favourite things, including, perhaps, Julia. Unfortunately, not all t-shirt designs get printed, and there are many ideas that won’t, or shouldn’t, make it into wearable form.</p>
<p>Here are a few rejected Julia-related t-shirt designs that you won’t be wearing this year&#33;</p>
<p>Warning: some of the following might not be very amusing, interesting, or inoffensive.</p>
<h3 id="ai"><a href="#ai" class="header-anchor">AI</a></h3>
<p>These two letters appearing together – “a” and “i” – have started to provoke in me a slight case of “irritable vowel syndrome”, because recently they’ve been occurring virtually everywhere and in everything. Visually, though, the iconography and symbology for all the “AI” things I see consists mainly of pictures of brains and electronic circuit diagrams &#40;which date back to World War 2, I think&#41;.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rejects/circuitry.png" alt="ai circuitry nonsense" /></p>
<p>However, drawing them by hand is quite tedious. This example was rendered by a few dozen autonomous grid-space agents that George and his team over at <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/Agents.jl">JuliaDynamics</a> keep trained up specially for jobs like this.</p>
<h3 id="periodical"><a href="#periodical" class="header-anchor">Periodical</a></h3>
<p>There aren’t any elements in the periodic table that start with the letter “J”, so this is an obvious idea to try.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rejects/element.png" alt="the element of " /></p>
<p>“Julium” or “Julianium” aren’t good, though. And the number 137 is cool, but unfortunately meaningless. The slogan is a stretch, too.</p>
<h3 id="carry_on"><a href="#carry_on" class="header-anchor">Carry on</a></h3>
<p>Although dating from 1939, the famous &#40;in the UK at least&#41; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On">Keep Calm and Carry On</a> motivational campaign lives on today.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rejects/keep-calm.png" alt="keep calm and" /></p>
<p>This image has gradually morphed into irony, particularly with the UK&#39;s right wing political party recently proposing a return to compulsory military service. The crown is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tudor_Crown">Henry VIII&#39;s</a>, and he was a amoral thug, so I&#39;m not sure the crown is providing much positive energy here.</p>
<h3 id="helvetica_bold"><a href="#helvetica_bold" class="header-anchor">Helvetica Bold</a></h3>
<p>I&#39;ve seen many variations of this t-shirt. Here it&#39;s the names of the four original founders of Julia:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rejects/helvetica-list-t.png" alt="helvetica list " /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/29936/john-and-paul-and-ringo-and-george-and-and-an">original</a>, by Japanese apparel company 2K/Gingham, dates from 2001. The ampersands were originally introduced in order to make the shorter names match better with the longer name. Thus the order of the names is just a function of their length - so Stefan gets the short &#40;well, long&#41; straw here.</p>
<h3 id="musical_interlude"><a href="#musical_interlude" class="header-anchor">Musical interlude</a></h3>
<p>Some musical notation as a change from mathematical notation.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rejects/music.png" alt="music" /></p>
<p>It&#39;s impractical to put musical references on a t-shirt. For one thing, not everyone can read musical notation. For another, the music industry is famously litigious about even short musical phrases &#40;here&#39;s YouTube&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;zgsL5yW3bao">Legal Eagle</a> on the topic&#41;, so it would be madness to put the notes of a quite famous &#40;if ancient&#41; hit tune on a t-shirt. Even if lawyers can&#39;t all read music, they can afford to pay people who can.</p>
<h3 id="heart_speech"><a href="#heart_speech" class="header-anchor">Heart speech</a></h3>
<p>This spin on Milton Glaser’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_New_York">iconic design</a> here hopes that people would know what “.JL” means.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rejects/iheartjl.png" alt="i heart jl" /></p>
<p>But it’s probably too much of an over-used cliché to have much appeal.</p>
<h3 id="memory_lane"><a href="#memory_lane" class="header-anchor">Memory lane</a></h3>
<p>This is JuliaCoin, an NFT-blockchain-crypto design. Remember these?</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rejects/juliacoin.png" alt="julia coin nft" /></p>
<p>I think only one JuliaCoin exists, on my hard drive. I&#39;m not sure about the maths, so either it’s incredibly valuable, or it’s worthless. Wait - 50-50 odds? I feel lucky. To the moon&#33;</p>
<h3 id="forgotten_kingdom"><a href="#forgotten_kingdom" class="header-anchor">Forgotten kingdom</a></h3>
<p>Once upon the time, dinosaurs walked the earth, and dinosaurs were cool.  </p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rejects/jurassic.png" alt="jurassic" /></p>
<p>Also once upon a time, dinosaur movies were cool. But I&#39;m not sure that being associated with dinosaurs or so-so sequels is good marketing.</p>
<h3 id="luxurious"><a href="#luxurious" class="header-anchor">Luxurious</a></h3>
<p>The Julia package Luxor.jl is 10 years old this year, and the logo is just some ancient-Egyptian beetle in a cartouche, drawn with Luxor.jl.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rejects/luxor-x.png" alt="luxor" /></p>
<p>The trouble with a t-shirt with this design is that only one person would probably be interested in wearing it – and I know for a fact that they never wear t-shirts.</p>
<h3 id="da_vinci_coding"><a href="#da_vinci_coding" class="header-anchor">Da Vinci coding</a></h3>
<p>Mr Brown codes.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rejects/ambigram.png" alt="ambigram" /></p>
<p>Chapter 4</p>
<p>Robert Langdon looked thoughtfully at the body of the man on the floor, and then knelt down to look at the design on the t-shirt the corpse was still wearing. The renowned Harvard symbologist placed his fingertips together, and pondered thoughtfully for a minute, as if he was formulating a reply to an uncharacteristically insightful question from one of his students. He slowly circled the body once. Then he turned to his young companion with a confident nod.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s an ambigram, and we call this particular style a <em>homogram</em>, because of the rotational symmetry. What’s puzzling though...”</p>
<p>The famous professor interrupted himself. He quickly grabbed the corpse’s legs, and swung the body round through half a circle.</p>
<p>“You see, Sophie” - he turned again to address the beautiful young French cryptographer who was still standing next to him - “The strange thing is, that the design appears upside down <em>whichever way round you look at it</em>&#33;”</p>
<p>Sophie gasped with surprise. After a thoughtful pause, she slowly whispered:</p>
<p>“<em>Oui, Robert, peut-être</em> - but surely the design appears the right way up to the person wearing it if they look down at it?”</p>
<p>Langdon shook his powerful head slowly. </p>
<p>“No, I think the corpse must have put on the t-shirt the wrong way round while he was still alive. Otherwise, the only way he would be able to see the design is if he stood with his back to a mirror and looked over his shoulder...”</p>
<p>&#40;not from “The Da Vinci Code” by Dan Brown&#41;</p>
<h3 id="the_dark_side"><a href="#the_dark_side" class="header-anchor">The dark side</a></h3>
<p>The prism creates the Julia colors.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rejects/prism.png" alt="dark prism" /></p>
<p>I&#39;m no physicist, but I think the optical behaviour of light in this image is unscientific.</p>
<h3 id="ummm"><a href="#ummm" class="header-anchor">Ummm</a></h3>
<p>This is Sengai&#39;s The Univers &#40;from about 1800&#41;, drawn with the <code>Luxor.brush&#40;&#41;</code> function.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rejects/sengai.png" alt="sengai universe" /></p>
<p>I&#39;m a bit worried about the geometry going on here, as explained by Dr Suzuki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The circle represents the infinite, and the infinite is at the basis of all beings. But the infinite in itself is formless. We humans endowed with senses and intellect demand tangible forms. Hence a triangle. The triangle is the beginning of all forms. Out of it first comes the square. A square is the triangle doubled. This doubling process goes on infinitely and we have the multitudinosity of things, which the Chinese philosopher calls &#39;the ten thousand things&#39;, that is, the universe. <a href="https://terebess.hu/zen/sengai.html">Dr. Daisetz T. Suzuki</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="gooooooooooooooal"><a href="#gooooooooooooooal" class="header-anchor">Gooooooooooooooal</a></h3>
<p>To the joy of all football &#40;soccer&#41; fans who code in Julia, the <a href="https://juliacon.org/2024/">JuliaCon 2024 conference</a> is being held at the Philips Stadion, Eindhoven, the home of the PSV Eindhoven football club.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rejects/soccer.png" alt="soccer football" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, with this design, everyone would have to share the same shirt number. And in football, all the shirt numbers are significant, being associated with particular players. For example, Ronaldo has 28 and 7 &#40;and 9&#41;. Johan Cruyff, 14. David Beckham, 23, Lionel Messi, 30. It would be unfair to any commentators if everyone wore the same 24 shirt.</p>
<h3 id="hubbub"><a href="#hubbub" class="header-anchor">Hubbub</a></h3>
<p>A nice simple image with a strong, hacker-friendly orange color theme.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rejects/juliahub.png" alt="hub" /></p>
<p>However, I think the name has <a href="https://juliahub.com">already been taken</a>.</p>
<h3 id="body_image"><a href="#body_image" class="header-anchor">Body image</a></h3>
<p>The three-body problem: I&#39;ve not read the book or seen the TV series, but I do like Kirk Long&#39;s <a href="https://botsin.space/@ThreeBodyBot">three body problem</a> Mastodon bot.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rejects/three-body.png" alt="the three body" /></p>
<p>I’m not a fan of the slogan here. Also, Luxor is really struggling to get a good 3D ‘atmosphere’ &#40;albeit in the vacuum of space&#41;, so it’s a task probably more suited for Makie or Blender. Also also, it reminds me of those unsettling scenes in sci-fi movies where unfeasibly huge stars and planets are just hanging in the sky, seemingly without exerting much gravitational influence.</p>
<p>That&#39;s enough rejects for now&#33;</p>
